# Skeumorphic Bookshelf

This is a JS project that is designed to look like a real life bookshelf, with the books moving when hovered over. It is pretty accurate. It can persist books, alongside automatically getting the covers for the books (using the OpenLibrary API) and removing books.

To run it yourself:
- Install node and npm and react
- Go to skeumorphic-bookshelf, run `npm start`

You can also go to the [demo site](https://skeumorphicbookshelfs.web.app/), BUT IT IS VERY GLITCHY, DUE TO CORS. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH TO JUST RUN IT YOURSELF.
